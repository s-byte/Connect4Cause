<div class = "h2"><p>Hi! I'm going to be a senior in high school next year, and I am really passionate about this website because it combines helping the community with exploring new parts of the world. Also, I believe that there are many animals and people out there who need help from people like us. A little intention can go a long way!</p></div>

<div class = "h2"><p>Hey there! I am currently a student with a passion for traveling. I love exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and trying new foods. I think traveling is invaluable and volunteering locally will only heighten this experience. I recently volunteered in New Zealand and only wished there was a site like this around to help me pick an opportunity in the area. I will definitely be using HelpOut on trips to come! </p></div>

<div class = "h2"><p>Hey y'all! I'm a student, athlete, and love doing volunteer work. I love getting out and helping in any way I can, even locally. For example I have done multiple fundraisers for the SPCA and have been part of the Interact Club and Key Club which are both volunteering clubs from 6th grade to present. I also love going to Alaska every year to go hiking in the forests or glaciers, and fishing.</p></div>
